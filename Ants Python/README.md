# ANTS VS BEES

## Project Description

This is a game coded in Python where ants defend their colony from invading bees. The game takes place in a tunnel. Each turn, new bees may enter, the player can place ants, and then all insects act: Ants gather food or attack, while bees move forward or sting. The bees win if a bee reaches the tunnel’s end or kills the QueenAnt, and the ants win if all bees are defeated.
